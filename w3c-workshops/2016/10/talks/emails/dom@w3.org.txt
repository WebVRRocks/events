Hi, Dominique!

Thanks for being part of the first W3C Workshop on Web and Virtual Reality. As you may know, Mozilla sent an ad-hoc video crew and they were able to capture portions of many of the sessions. Sadly, due to unforeseen circumstances at the venue, we did not succeed in capturing a good or complete recording of your talk. Please accept our apologies.

We’re putting together a YouTube playlist called “W3C Workshop on Web and Virtual Reality” - which will include at the minimum a brief compilation video from the event and a video of the keynote talk by Mozilla SVP, Sean White.

We wanted to give you the heads-up that we’ll be publishing these in the coming weeks, beginning with these recordings:

    Title:
        W3C Workshop on Web and Virtual Reality: A Compilation

We’re sincerely sorry that we don’t have a complete record of this Workshop - and look forward to future convening.

Thanks for your participation in the Workshop, for giving your talk, and for offering your patience and understanding!


Best,
